------------
This is a tetris game that I wrote in 1999.
You won't find much design concerns in the source code, but it just works.

Compilation
============
Requirements: MSVC++ (6.0 or greater), MFC

Open *.dsw file, and build the solution.

Alternatively, you can use pre-built binary under Release/ directory.
